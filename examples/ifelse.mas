/ #L10 	Is beginning of an if control block, where an the value of an expression is determined.
/		In this case were comparing `EXP` to 0.
/ #L14	Is the body of the if statement, we output `IVALUE` and `JUMP` to `end`.
/		We `JUMP` to avoid running code from `else`.
/ #L18	Is the body of the else statement, we output `EVALUE` and continue running the program.
/		Unlike the body of the if statment we don't need to `JUMP`; instead we can continue.
/ #L11	If `EXP` is not 0 then then SKIPCOND will not skip over #L12 forcing a `JUMP`.
